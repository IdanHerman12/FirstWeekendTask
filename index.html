                A mummy is a dead human or an animal whose soft tissues and organs have been preserved by either intentional or accidental exposure to chemicals, extreme cold, very low humidity, or lack of air, so that the recovered body does not decay further if kept in cool and dry conditions.
               </p>
               <p>The practice of preserving a body as a mummy is widespread across the globe and throughout time.<br>
                 Many civilizations—Incan, Australian aboriginal, Aztec, African, ancient European and others—have practiced some type of mummification for thousands of years to honor and preserve the bodies of the dead.

            <p>
             Mummies are typically divided into one of two distinct categories: anthropogenic or spontaneous.<br>
             </p>
             <p>
             Anthropogenic mummies were deliberately created by the living for any number of reasons, the most common being for religious purposes.<br>
             Spontaneous mummies, were created unintentionally due to natural conditions such as extremely dry heat or cold, or anaerobic conditions.

                   Many of the Mummies we know came from Egypt and it was a cultural rituals in the past.<br>
                   Over one million animal mummies have been found in Egypt, many of which are cats. Many of the Egyptian animal mummies are<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_sacred_ibis"> sacred ibis</a> .

           <p>Egyptians saw the preservation of the body after death as an important step to living well in the afterlife.
           </p>
            <p>
            As Egypt gained more prosperity, burial practices became a status symbol for the wealthy as well.<br>
            This cultural hierarchy lead to the creation of elaborate tombs, and more sophisticated methods of embalming(a burial method for preserving the dead body).<br>
        </p>
        <p>In Christian tradition, some bodies of saints are naturally conserved and venerated.</p>

               <b>The most "expensive" method</b><br>
               First, the brain was removed from the cranium through the nose; the gray matter was discarded. Modern mummy excavations have shown that instead of an iron hook inserted through the nose as Herodotus claims, a rod was used to liquefy the brain via the cranium, which then drained out the nose by gravity. The embalmers then rinsed the skull with certain drugs that mostly cleared any residue of brain tissue and also had the effect of killing bacteria. Next, the embalmers made an incision along the flank with a sharp blade fashioned from an Ethiopian stone and removed the contents of the abdomen. Herodotus does not discuss the separate preservation of these organs and their placement either in special jars or back in the cavity, a process that was part of the most expensive embalming, according to archaeological evidence.
           </p>
           <p>
               <b>Avoiding expense method</b><br>
               this method, an oil derived from cedar trees was injected with a syringe into the abdomen. A rectal plug prevented the oil from escaping. This oil probably had the dual purpose of liquefying the internal organs but also of disinfecting the abdominal cavity.<br>
               The body was then placed in natron for seventy days. At the end of this time, the body was removed and the cedar oil, now containing the liquefied organs, was drained through the rectum.<br>
               With the body dehydrated, it could be returned to the family.Poorer people used coffins fashioned from terracotta.
           </p>
           <p>
               <b>Inexpensive method </b><br>  
The third and least-expensive method the embalmers offered was to clear the intestines with an unnamed liquid, injected as an enema. The body was then placed in natron for seventy days and returned to the family.
